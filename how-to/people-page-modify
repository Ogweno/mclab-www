To modify the people's section, open the _data/people.yml file in the site root folder.

The following template should be used for adding a new person: 

- name: "" 
 type: ""
 email: "" 
 website: ""
 projects: 
   - name: "" 
     link: ""
 description: ""
 image: "

The spacing matters since yaml is strict on it. None of the information is
strictly required except the type, however, all the entries must be there in the entry.
The list of types is available on the top of the yaml file. Its good to have as much as possible.

If a project has been added to the website then simply add the name that is in 
the _data/project.yml file and it will use the link on that source. Otherwise
you may explicitly add the link. You can have multiple projects, just copy and 
paste the name/link lines and ensure the spacing is preserved.

Description gets processed as markdown but it seems to fight against the 
yaml processor. To break paragraphs, use two hard breaks (press enter 3 times). 

Images should be stored in the images/people folder and should be written in the 
following format : "/images/people/filename.ext". Example: "/images/people/vineet.jpg".
Note the space before images must be there. 

**NOTE: Please watch out for extra spaces in names, it will messup the interlinking
between files. Also please escape double quotes with backslash (e.g. \").
