To modify publications, open the _data/publications.yml file in the site root folder.

The following template should be used for adding a new person: 

- title: ""
  link: "" 
  type: "" 
  abstract: ""
  authors: 
    - "" 
    - "" 
  date: ""
  publisher: "" 
  location: ""
  bibTexEntry: "" 

The spacing matters since yaml is strict on it. None of the information is
strictly required except the type, however, all the entries must be there in the entry.
The list of types is available on the top of the yaml file. Its good to have as much as possible.

Author names should match the ones on the _data/people.yml file. If not, no link
to their page will be displayed. 

Publisher is either the conference or journal name for papers. It is either 
"Master's Thesis" or "PhD Thesis" for theses. It is the Sable Technical Report
id for Tech Reports. Finally its the location of presentation for the lectures
and tutorials. 

Abstract gets processed as markdown but it seems to fight against the 
yaml processor. To break paragraphs, use two hard breaks (press enter 3 times). 

If a new publication is being added and it is associated with a project then please
add the name of the publication to the project. 

**NOTE: Please watch out for extra spaces in names, it will messup the interlinking
between files. Also please escape double quotes with backslash (e.g. \").
