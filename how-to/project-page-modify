Modifying the project page requires going through a few files. 

ADDING A NEW PROJECT: 
====================

First you need to add the following template to the _data/projects.yml file: 

- name: "" 
  category: ""
  link: ""
  status: ""
  description: ""
  publications:
    - ""

Categories are listed in _data/research-categories.yml

You have two choices: 

1. Make your own webpage for the project and link to it 
2. Use the provided template 

1. Make your Own Webpage:
  If you want to make or already have made your own web page then simply fill
  in the link, status and description fields. No need to fill in publications. If
  you want to point to publications on your webpage then you will have to add
  them yourself. 


2. User Provided Template: 
  To use the provided template you have to do a few preparation steps. Go to
  the site root folder and enter the projects directory. Make a directory for
  your project. Copy the templates/project.index.html.template file in the
  templates folder above the site root to this directory. Change the name to
  index.html. Open the file, you will notice three fields enclosed in two lines
  (triple dashes). For the project key enter the name of your project that you
  put into the _data/projects.yml file.

  The other two fields point to two markdown files. The first markdown file
  should reside in _includes/projects/ from the site root directory. This
  markdown file should contain all your relevant project description and nothing
  regarding the download and installation of your project.

  The second markdown file should reside in _inlcudes/projects/downloads when
  traversing from the site root directory. This file should contain any download
  and install instructions. If there are no such entities for your project then
  just create a blank file.

MODIFYING AN EXISTING PROJECT:
=============================

Change Research Category: 
  Edit the _data/research-categories.yml file. Add or change the research
  category you would like following the same format as the rest. If you change a
  research category then make sure you change all relevant field in the
  _data/projects.yml file that use that category.


Change Description/Link/Status of a project: 
  Simply change the entry in _data.projects.yml file. 

Change the name of a project: 
  If you change the name then it will affect everythin else that points to it. So
  unless you want to figure out everything that points to it and change them
  individually, don't.

Modify the people in the project: 
  You have to add or remove the project from the person's description in the
  data.people.yml file.

Change the project page: 
  If you are using the provided template you can not move the people and
  publications section without going to the Liquid Template. You are also limited
  to the css enforced by the site. If you want to change the description or setup
  information then go to /projects under the site root directory and goto the
  relevant project folder. Open the index.html file. Go to  _includes/projects/
  for the description or _inlcudes/projects/downloads/ and find the file pointed
  to by the template file. Edit them using relevant markdown.


  Also note, that if a thesis, paper and tech report share the same title in the 
  publications page then only one needs to be added to the project description. 
  It will list all of them and annotate them accordingly.
