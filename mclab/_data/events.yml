- name: "Git"
  date : "23rd September 2014"
  time : "12 noon"
  location : "MC320 McConnell"
  abstract : "Git is a version control system that has been gaining in popularity, but it has
a reputation for a steep learning curve and an intimidating command line
interface. In order to avoid having to memorize arcane incantations to make git
do what we want, it can be beneficial to learn to reason about how git actually
works.

This presentation will be in equal parts theoretical and practical. To keep
things computer sciencey we'll talk about git's underlying data model and how
git does what it does, but there will be illustrative live demos throughout, so
if you've never used git, you should walk away with a working knowledge of how
the most common commands are used, in addition to a high-level picture of how
the whole thing works."
