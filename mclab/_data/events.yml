- name: "McNumJS" 
  date: "16th September 2014" 
  time: "12 Noon" 
  location: "MC320 McConnell "
  abstract: "McNumJS is a numerical library for JavaScript which provides NumPy
    like API and it uses recent JavaScript features like Typed Arrays to make it
    fast. The presentation will discuss the development and architecture of the
    library as well as some initial performance results. Anyone interested in
    developing numerical application in JavaScript, will find this talk
    resourceful." 
- name: "Git"
  date : "23rd September 2014"
  time : "12 noon"
  location : "MC320 McConnell"
  abstract : "Git is a version control system that has been gaining in popularity, but it has
a reputation for a steep learning curve and an intimidating command line
interface. In order to avoid having to memorize arcane incantations to make git
do what we want, it can be beneficial to learn to reason about how git actually
works.

This presentation will be in equal parts theoretical and practical. To keep
things computer sciencey we'll talk about git's underlying data model and how
git does what it does, but there will be illustrative live demos throughout, so
if you've never used git, you should walk away with a working knowledge of how
the most common commands are used, in addition to a high-level picture of how
the whole thing works."

- name: "VeloCty"
  date : "30th September 2014"
  time : "12 noon"
  location : "MC320 McConnell"
  abstract : "VeloCty is an optimizing static compiler for Matlab and Python and performs partial compilation of code written in these two languages to parallel C++. Matlab and Python with its NumPy library are also gaining popularity among scientists and mathematicians. These languages provide many features which allow easy prototyping. However these same features inhibit performance of the code. We developed VeloCty as a solution to the problem of enhancing performance of programs written in these languages.VeloCty takes as input, functions written in Matlab and Python which are defined by the user as computationally intensive and generates an equivalent C++ version.&nbsp; The talk will focus on the&nbsp; challenges of supporting the semantics of two languages, implementation and design on VeloCty and the performance improvement seen as a result of the compilation."
