              MATLAB is a popular dynamic programming language used for scientific and
              numerical programming. As a language, it has evolved from a small scripting
              language intended as an interactive interface to numerical libraries, to a very
              popular language supporting many language features and libraries.  The
              overloaded syntax and dynamic nature of the language, plus the somewhat organic
              addition of language features over the years, makes static analysis of modern
              MATLAB quite challenging.   Furthermore, there is a real lack of
              publicly-available tools which has inhibited research on this very important
              real-world language.

              <p style="margin-bottom: 1em;">
              The purpose of this tutorial is to introduce McLab, a new publicly-available
              toolkit for analyzing and executing MATLAB programs.   The tutorial starts
              by introducing the MATLAB language and the particular challenges the language
              presents for compiler developers.  It then presents the McLab front-end,
              which supports both standard MATLAB, prebuilt extensions such as AspectMatlab,
              and the ability to create new language extensions.  The middle part of the
              tutorial focuses on the IRs and  analysis framework along with some example analyses.
              The final part of the tutorial presents the back-ends, with a particular
              emphasis on the McVM JIT.

              <h4> Structure of the Tutorial </h4>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 1em;">
              The tutorial follows the structure of the toolkit.  There are
              four major parts: <br/>
              <ol style="list-style: decimal; padding-left: 2em">
                <li>Introduce the MATLAB language and the specific challenges this language
                raises for compiler researchers.</li>

                <li>Introduce the front-end, showing the overall structure and the basics of
                how to make a language extension.</li>

                <li>Describe the analysis framework and some sample analyses.</li>

                <li>Give an overview of McFor and McVM as examples of static and dynamic backends.</li> 
              </ol>
