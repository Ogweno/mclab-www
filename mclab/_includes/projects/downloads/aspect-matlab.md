A beta-release of the amc compiler is freely available to download
[here](http://www.sable.mcgill.ca/mclab/aspectmatlab/amc/amc.jar). A
detailed user manual is also available.

####Release Notes
The new AspectMatlab release addresses the following issues:

1. Support for the MATLAB *clear* statements

    The MATLAB clear removes variables and functions from memory. After weaving
    the actions of an aspect at joinpoints, the resultant MATLAB program contains
    both user-defined variables and variables defined by AspectMatlab. A clear
    statement executed by the program could remove variables defined by
    AspectMatlab and this could have a fatal effect on the program. This problem
    has been addressed in the current version of AspectMatlab.

2. Support for *end* expression used in a compound expression:

    The Matlab *end* expression refers to the last index in an indexing expression.
    AspectMatlab transforms a compound expression into simple expressions using
    temporary variables. The problem addressed by this extension is the potential
    loss of the association of an "end" expression with the innermost array
    variable in a compound expression. For example, in the expression
    **y(a(foo(end),1))**, where y and a are array variables and foo is a function, end
    refers to the index of the last element of a. If AspectMatlab was to simplify
    **foo(end)** out of the compound expression, the association with the array a would
    be lost.

3. Language extension for defining patterns for matching arithmetic operators: 

    The MATLAB programming language defines a variety of operators and the previous
    version of AspectMatlab is incapable of matching patterns based on these
    operators. Operations had to be matched based on functions. The new version of
    AspectMatlab allows programmers to define aspects that match directly
    arithmetic operations based on operators.


####Installation Details
Once you have a copy of amc.jar, you can execute the jar directly with a list
of standard Matlab files along with AspectMatlab aspect files. 

For example, one might run java -jar amc.jar myFunc.m myAspect.m. 

You will find woven code generated by amc in weaved directory in the current
working directory, which can be executed using any Matlab system.

####Sample Code
A list of aspect and base programs along with amc generated woven code is given
[here](http://www.sable.mcgill.ca/mclab/aspectmatlab/examples).
