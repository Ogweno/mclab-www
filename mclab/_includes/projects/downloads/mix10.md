###Source Code
McLab is open sourced under the Apache 2.0 license. The source code for MiX10
is still brewing and a complete and stable release will be made soon. In the
mean time you can see what's going on under the hood (and maybe get your hands
dirty too) at our [GitHub
repository](https://github.com/Sable/mclab/tree/develop/languages/Natlab/src/natlab/backends/x10).
