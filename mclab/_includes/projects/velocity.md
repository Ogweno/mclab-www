###OVERVIEW
VeloCty is a tool which compiles computationally intensive sections of MATLAB and NumPy code to parallel C++ for performance improvement. This type of selective compilation allows users to continue writing code in their preferred high-level language but with improved performance. Parallelism in C++ is achieved through OpenMP and OpenCL vectorisation constructs.
