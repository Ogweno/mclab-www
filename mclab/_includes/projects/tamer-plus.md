###Overview
For the convenience of analyzing Matlab code and collecting information for
later phase, tamer convert Matlab to a low level IR, tamerIR, almost three
address code. This low level IR has many temporary variables and not very
friendly human readable. Tamer+ aggregates those simplified code back to a
higher level IR and make them more human readable
