###Overview
Learning how to program has increasingly become a more important
skill for non-programmers in the tech industry or researchers outside of
computer science. Newer programming languages such as MATLAB have
grown into industrial strength languages, and many industries
and academic fields outside of math and computer science have found
uses for it. Thus, it is essential for many more people to learn MATLAB.
However, many people often learn it without fundamental knowledge in
programming concepts that are rooted in computer science. McTutorial 
aims to fill this gap.
