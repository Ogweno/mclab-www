In order for a compiler to perform optimizations or to provide
feedback to programmers, it must analyze the program source code. Making such
analyses easier to write requires a simple, well-defined Intermediate
Representation (IR) and analysis framework. This framework should also allow
new language extensions to use and adapt existing analyses. In spite of
MATLABâ€™s popularity, and the apparent need for static analysis, there has been
no publicly available framework for creating static analyses for the M ATLAB
programming language. The McLAB Static Analysis Framework, or McSAF is such a
framework. McSAF was created as part of the Mc L AB project to satisfy these
requirements. The goal of the framework is to make new analyses easy to write
and easy to extend to new language features.
